Categorical Variables (2):

1. subject.id: The number id that identifies the subject performing the test and training activities.

2. activity: The activities performed by the subjects. These include: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.




The analysis procedures:

1. First the script sets the directory of where files are located.

2. Next the script reads in the datasets X_test and X_train. Then the activities associated with the X_test and X_train are read in (y_test and y_train respectively). After that the subject ids associated with test and training sets are read in (subject_test and subject_train). All of the files were read in using the read.table function.

3. The script then merges the X_test/train dataset using the rbind function (merge by row). The subject test and train datasets as well as the y_test/train datasets are merged in the same fashion.

4. After merging the X_test/train, subject test/train, and y_test/train datasets, these merged datasets were then merged together to create one dataset using the cbind function (merge the columns of the datasets).

5. The features.txt file is then read in to determine which columns to extract. The script looks for the words mean() and std() using the grep function. meanFreq() is removed from the list of columns to extract by using the setdiff function.

6. The appropriate columns are extracted from the merged dataset using the cbind function and the mean_std_features list.

7. The script then reads in the activity_labels.txt file to change the activity index number to the actual activity name.

8. Next the column names are extracted from the features file and the column names are formatted to tidy dataset standards using the sub and gsub function. To change uppercase letters to lowercase, the perl extended mode is set to true and pattern and replace are set to ’([[:upper:]])' and '.\\L\\1' respectively.

9. Then the combined dataset is grouped by subjects and by activities using the group_by function. This will allow for the computation of the mean in the next step.

10. The tidy dataset is produced by calculating the average for each subject-activity pair using the suumarize_each function with the inside function set to mean. There are 180 observations and 68 variables.

11. The tidy dataset is then written out using the write.table function.
